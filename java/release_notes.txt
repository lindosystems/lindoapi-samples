OVERVIEW
This interface allows LINDO API to be called from java applications running 
on a java virtual machine (JVM). The interface consists of

	- lindoapi/bin/<platform>/lindojni.dll   (win32/64)
	- lindoapi/bin/<platform>/liblindojni.so (unix-like systems)
	- lindoapi/lib/<platform>/lindo<x_y>.jar
       
             where platform - platform name like win32, linux32, etc..
                   x - major version
                   y - minor version
         
	
The following scripts could be used to run the samples at command prompt.
	
	- samples/java/jtest.bat  (win32/64)
	- samples/java/jtest.sh   (unix-like systems)

RELEASE NOTES 7.0	
- API extensions

illustrates different alternatives when displaying progress information 
produced while solving a model.


RELEASE NOTES 6.1

- A stochastic programming application (ex_sp_newsboy) is added to sample list.

RELEASE NOTES 5.0
- API extensions
-  With the release of LINDO API 5.0.345, JNI support has been extended to 64-bit
platforms. This required the interface to use the generic java type 'Object'
as references to native LINDO API handles for pEnv and pModel. In the previous
versions, pEnv and pModel handles were declared as 'int' type. This definition is
no longer supported and the current interface is not backward compatible -- declaring
pEnv and pModel as 'int' is not possible from version 5.0.345 and forward. 

To be able to use the new release with your existing java applications, you should
modify the declarations of all pModel and pEnv handles from 'int[]' to 'Object'.  
The difference in declarations is illustrated below.

	Old declaration 

	{
		int pEnv[] = new int[1];
		int pModel[] = new int[1];
	}


	New declaration

	{
		Object pEnv = null;
		Object pModel = null;		
	}
		
See the sample applications under samples/java/* directory for usage.


- The java class archive 'lindo<x_y>.jar' is moved to lindoapi/lib/<platform>
directory. You can examine jtest.bat and jtest.sh how samples are built and run.
