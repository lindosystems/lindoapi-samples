- F90/95 Compiler Support Notes -

1- The F9x interfaces provided in lindoapi/include directory are specific to 
Intel F9x compilers. You may need to create similar interfaces to use 
LINDO API with other F9x compilers. 

2- The F9x interface 'lindo.fi' is located under 'lindoapi/include' folder and 
needs to be  included in your application source code as illustrated in sample 
applications under 'samples/fort' folder.

3- Prior to building your project, make sure to change your compiler settings so 
that 132 characters per line is allowed in the source files. If your compiler does 
not support 132 characters, you will need to modify "include\lindo.fi" manually 
so that the lines don't exceed 72 chars per line. 
 
 remark: Intel F9x compiler v10.x or later achieve this with '-132' compiler option
 and this is used in the makefiles provided.

4- You may need to edit the source file (samp1, samp2) and change the arguments 
of the "include" statements to lowercase. This could also be achieved with an
appropriate compiler option.

5- In building the samples on Linux, make sure to modify the makefile so that
- $CCOM points to the correct Intel F9x compiler
- $PLATFORM is appropriately chosen depending on target platform (32-bit
or 64-bit Linux)

6- Use the project solution file (*.sln) under 'samples/fort/samp1' to build
the sample on Win32 or Win64.


7- The interfaces pass variables and arrays by [VALUE] therefore heavily relies 
on F9x's LOC() function. See the samples for usage.
